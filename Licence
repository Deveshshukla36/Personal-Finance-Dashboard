### ðŸ“Œ To-Do Now

1. âœ… Let me know if you'll use **Streamlit or Dash**.
2. âœ… Iâ€™ll help you write `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and your GitHub description.
3. âœ… Once live, weâ€™ll also write a portfolio line and link.

Want me to generate the full working dashboard code (e.g. with dummy data and all visuals)?
